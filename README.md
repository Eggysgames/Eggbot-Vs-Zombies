Eggbot vs Zombies was inspired by the Call of Duty zombie mode. I thought hmm what would a 2D version be like? so I made this and tried to give it my own unique style. It came out quite decent.

You will find all the C# coding under assets/scripts

Developed using Unity by Eggy's Games (Bradley Erkelens).

=== Coding === 

All code refers to the Main.cs class

You will find the most important class is ShootingGun.cs which uses lineRenderer and raycasts to make instant shooting. Some of the code is a bit old and crude now with too many if commands, but the raycast parts are solid to be used for shooting.
